Transit Gateway allows VPC's to be connected together into a single network as well as connecting to on-prem networks.
This example will deploy a simple setup with 2 VPC's being connected together.
The Terraform code can be found on GitHub. The code also includes a RAM (Resource Access Manager) share for linking VPC's in separate accounts but in this examples it's not used.
Just update any the reqruired settings in variables.</description></item></channel></rss>
