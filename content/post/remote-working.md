**I’ve been working remotely now for over 10 years, initially as a choice but more recently virtually enforced owing to ill health. Over the years, remote working has enabled me to move to a remote part of Scotland and still enjoy the day-to-day integrations of working with many skilled engineers spread all around the globe. Without the ability to work remotely, I would now be unable to work; the likelihood of me getting into an office every day nowadays is virtually zero.**

Over the years, I’ve seen examples of suitable and mediocre environments. Most recently, I experienced probably the worst set-up I have ever encountered, which led me to write about it. It made me appreciate the importance of proper setup to ensure successful remote working. Everyone’s ideal environment is different; some may completely disagree with what I think is right or wrong, but this is my take.

Video: Ten years ago, video was a luxury, and poor internet and immature technology meant video was often not switched on during calls. At the time, it wasn’t an issue for me as I had met most of my colleagues face to face, so I could visualise who I was talking to and know some of their mannerisms. As the years passed, video has improved to the point where it can be comfortably enabled most of the time, which has enabled, especially during COVID-19, to cut down on face-to-face meetings.
  
Face to Face meetings: Yes, remote is excellent, but occasional time together is still a good idea; I’m not advocating hybrid working, but a few days together to bond as a team is always good. It probably only needs to be every 3 to 6 months, but I believe it helps build a great team. I’ve just come to the end of a year’s project where I never met anyone I was working with; costs and delivery pressures were always mentioned, but knowing the people you are working with also has value.

Slack (or any other good chat tool): Something like Slack has become a game changer for remote working. It allows for group and personal conversations in an asynchronous way, which is ideally suited for remote work. It is a game changer; if used poorly, it can become another annoyance. Recently, I’ve experienced an environment where @now, @channel, and @name were used most of the time, and people wanted instant responses to questions. This, to me, is an anti-pattern, and I found it to be amazingly disruptive. Also, there was a trend to DM someone and not ask a question; too often, I had a DM with a Hi or Good morning with no context, making it hard to prioritise important messages.

Good channel management is also a requirement when using Slack. Teams should have an area where they can share and brainstorm ideas without worrying about who else sees the message. Recently, I have had team channels with 50+ users, including senior managers. This did nothing to help the psychological safety of the team. Frequently, chats were spun out into smaller private groups, meaning important decisions were missed or not fully informed.

Meetings: Meetings disrupt the working day. They should have a purpose rather than be the default option to solve a problem. Before scheduling a meeting, other options, such as email or Slack, should be considered to make the process less intrusive.

The same should be applied to agile ceremonies; no set rule for their number or duration should exist. Retrospectives make sense at the end of each sprint at the formation of a new team, but six months down the line, monthly or bi-monthly ones might add more value. But they should still be done; otherwise, learning will get lost.

In summary, an exemplary remote environment requires work to achieve. Companies spend considerable money and effort setting up cool office environments but fail to pay the same for their remote setups. Having the right mix allows the best engineers to do the job rather than those who can get into the office.
