For a long time I've been wanting to look at some way of testing terraform. As part of this I've recently looked using terratest and localstack.
While localstack looks promising lots of the things I wanted to test are either in the pro version or not supported so I went back to using live AWS accounts. It would be nice to be able to use localstack in a pipeline, hopefully in the future.</description></item></channel></rss>
