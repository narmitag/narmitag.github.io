            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve been working remotely now for over 10 years, initially as a choice but more recently virtually enforced owing to ill health. Over the years, remote working has enabled me to move to a remote part of Scotland and still enjoy the day-to-day integrations of working with many skilled engineers spread all around the globe. Without the ability to work remotely, I would now be unable to work; the likelihood of me getting into an office every day nowadays is virtually zero.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
