I’ve been working remotely now for over 10 years, initially as a choice but more recently virtually enforced owing to ill health. Over the years remote working has enabled me to move to a remote part of Scotland and still enjoy the day-to-day integrations of working with a bunch of skilled engineers spread all around the globe. I think without the ability to work remotely I would now be unable to work, the likelihood of me getting into an office every day nowadays is virtually zero.</description></item></channel></rss>
